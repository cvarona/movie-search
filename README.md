# MovieSearch

TL;DR: a simple user interface to the services provided by [the Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

I've used Angular's Material CDK in order to save efforts with the UI and to profit from its virtual scroll capabilities, but I've not intended to follow the Material UX guidelines.

OMDB does not provide, to the best of my knowledge, any swagger or formal description to its api, so I've manually created the needed data structures.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
